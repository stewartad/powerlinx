A small Go library for serving static pages alongside dynamic content

# Overview

For personal websites, I love the idea of static webpages and manually creating the content hosted on my sites. However, after using many static site generators, I often found I wanted my websites to be more flexible and have some dynamic content as well as the static content. Thus this project aims to collect static html files for use in a Go web application and is designed to have minimal dependencies, currently only uses the standard library.
